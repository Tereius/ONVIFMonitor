# ONVIFMonitor

This is a project I started some years ago but never finished (and probably will never finish). But it is of great use for developers who
want to learn how build an ONVIF qml app using [libONVIF](https://github.com/Tereius/libONVIF). The most basic features of an ONVIF camera
viwer/monitor should work like:

* Basic ONVIF device configuration
* Observing of ONVIF Media profiles
* Video/Audio-Stream playback using QtAV
* Event handling (partially implemented, this is where I stopped)

I hope that this project will be useful for you.

Please don't open feature requests. At the moment I have no intention to continue working on the project.
