How to build and install Archivist binaries
===========================================

To help CMake find dependencies add a system variable with the name "CMAKE_HINT" which points to a directory where the libraries are located.
CMake will automatically search for the subdirectories "asdcpmodlib" and "xercescpp". Also you can add the directory of a library directly to "CMAKE_HINT".

-------

Using cmake (see www.cmake.org). A out-out-source build is strongly recommended!

Type:
cd <project_root>/build
cmake ../
